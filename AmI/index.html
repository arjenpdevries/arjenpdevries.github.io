<h2>Ambient Intelligence</h2>
<p>
<em>Ambient Intelligence</em> (AmI) aims to improve the quality of people's 
life by making everyday activities more convenient and enjoyable with digital 
media. Technically, Ambient Intelligence refers to the presence of a digital 
environment that is sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to the presence of 
people. Electronic devices are embedded in furniture, clothing or other parts 
of the environment; the technology recedes into the background of our everyday
lives until only the function (i.e., the user interface) remains visible to 
people. At the same time, the human moves into the center of attention, in 
control of the devices around him. These work in concert to support the performance 
of everyday activities in an intelligent manner.
</p>
<p>
Producing such smart ubiquitous computing environments on a large scale
is problematic. In the foreseeable future, it is technologically infeasible
mass-produce a product or service that generates Ambient Intelligence, given 
the current state-of-the-art in machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
The alternative to manually design and produce Ambient Intelligence applications 
for each person individually is not realistic economically. So the question 
arises how to customize Ambient Intelligence environments on a mass basis?
</p>
<h2>Ambient Narratives</h2>
<p>
Mark van Doorn (Philips) and Arjen P. de Vries (CWI) are creating a system
architecture inspired by the web to specify Ambient Intelligence services 
as <em>Ambient Narratives</em>. Modular Ambient Intelligence descriptions called
<em>beats</em> are assembled dynamically into personalized, interactive media 
presentations in mixed-reality, where multiple devices may participate 
simultaneously. Ambient narratives have the following characteristics:
<dl>
<dt>Interactive:</dt>
<dd>Reading an ambient narrative creates a user's own unique, personal experience 
from a large set of possible choices defined by the author of the interactive
narrative.</dd>
<dt>Situated in mixed reality:</dt>
<dd>Existing forms of interactive narratives and drama are situated in either the real 
world (architecture, improvisational theatre, visual art) or the virtual world 
(virtual reality simulations, adventure games). In contrast, ambient narratives 
have both a real-world and a virtual component. Reading an ambient narrative 
corresponds to performing in a mixed reality environment; we skip a
&quot;page&quot; as we move from one room into the next. In contrast to augmented 
reality applications, users do not necessarily need special equipment such as 
head-mounted displays or see-through glasses to experience these virtual objects. 
The virtual objects are presented through the individual devices that surround 
users. Each device generates only a part of the final experience.</dd>
<dt>Non-fictional:</dt>
<dd>Ambient narratives can be designed for pure entertainment or
infotainment but will be mostly designed to support people in their everyday
life activities and rituals (e.g. brushing teeth, cooking etc.).</dd>
