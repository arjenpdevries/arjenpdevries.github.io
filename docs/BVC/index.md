title: Brightspace Virtual Classroom (BVC)
---

## Introduction

And then, Friday 13th, 2020, we suddenly found ourselves having to invent an approach to distant learning,
without any chance to prepare ourselves!

Like probably 100% of my colleagues, we moved to Brightspace last year and were happy to operate a table of contents,
maybe a survey. I for example had never used Brightspace Virtual Classroom before, and I cannot say that the UI/UX 
is optimal for stepping in without much time for preparation.

But, we held two group meetings, two trial sessions, and now a first MSc defense.
Congratulations with your well deserved MSc degree, Roel Bouman!

## MSc defense in BVC

Let me walk you through the peculiarities and general setup for hosting the MSc defense.

### Scheduling



### Moderating



### Discussion


## Conclusion

Overall, the experience has been a success, given the circumstances.
Of course, a live defense would be highly preferable, but I asked the participants to leave a message stating 
their experience in the public chat, and these were all positive.
Look for yourselves!
