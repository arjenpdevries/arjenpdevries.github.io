title: Brightspace Virtual Classroom (BVC)

## Introduction

And then, Friday 13th, 2020, we suddenly found ourselves having to invent an approach to distant learning,
without any chance to prepare ourselves!

Like probably 100% of my colleagues, we moved to Brightspace last year and were happy to operate a table of contents,
maybe a survey. I for example had never used Brightspace Virtual Classroom before, and I cannot say that the UI/UX 
is optimal for stepping in without much time for preparation.

But, we held two group meetings, two trial sessions, and now a first MSc defense.
Congratulations with your well deserved MSc degree, Roel Bouman!

## MSc defense in BVC

Let me walk you through the peculiarities and general setup for hosting the MSc defense.

### Scheduling

Scheduling the meeting is straightforward. The documentation still mentions that you have to invite everyone, but that
is not true any more since the recent [Brightspace update][update]. You find the link to distribute to external participants
(and, honestly, this is handy for internal participants too) and launch the meeting from the item-menu in the schedule:
![][item-menu-schedule]

The organiser (and kind of a super-moderator) has to enter the room before any others can. 
Everyone sees a count-down to the moment that the event has been scheduled (which could have been "now", suitable for 
other meetings than a scheduled lecture or defence):
![][enter-meeting-room]

Eventually, we settled on letting people enter the room 5 minutes before the real start of the event, to ensure limited
loss of time at the start on mingling with audio settings. The early participants saw this [PDF](roel-msc-welcome.pdf)
I uploaded, detailing the session rules:

### Moderating

After entering the room as the first person, the organiser can modify the session's settings; e.g. turning off cameras 
to reduce network traffic ![][no-cam] and turning off private chats to keep people's attention to the presentation 
![][no-priv-chat].

The organiser can then hand over the presenter token to the candidate. Hereto, open the people tab by clicking on the 
top left of the screen, and look for the student who will present; you see the following menu upon click:
![][moderator-presenter]

### Discussion


## Conclusion

Since the [March 27th Brightspace update][update] we have access to breakout rooms. We thought about using that for 
the grading discussion while leaving the attendees to chat in the main room, but it was not immediately clear that
no-one could listen in so we opted to simply have a telephone call and then re-enter the room.

Overall, the experience has been a success, especially given the circumstances. The technology held up remarkably well, 
fortunately. Of course, a live MSc defense with audience would be highly preferable, but I asked the participants to 
use the chat to describe their experience, look for yourselves!
