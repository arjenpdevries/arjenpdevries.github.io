<H1>ABSTRACT</H1>

A database management system is a general-purpose software system that
facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, and manipulating databases
for various applications. The main characteristic of the &quot;database
approach&quot; is that it increases the value of data by its emphasis on data
independence. DBMSs, and in particular those based on the relational data
model, have been very successful at the management of administrative data in
the business domain.
<P>
This thesis has investigated data management in multimedia digital libraries,
and its implications on the design of database management systems.  The main
problem of multimedia data management is providing access to the stored
objects. The content structure of administrative data is easily represented in
alphanumeric values. Thus, database technology has primarily focused on
handling the objects' logical structure. In the case of multimedia data,
representation of content is far from trivial though, and not supported by
current database management systems.
<P>
The information retrieval (IR) community has since long studied the retrieval
of text documents by their content. Also, research in topics like computer
vision and image analysis has led to content-based retrieval techniques for
querying image and audio collections.  Retrieval systems based on these ideas
are typically standalone systems that have been developed for very specific
applications. There is not much consensus on the integration of these
techniques in general-purpose DBMSs. State-of-the-art solutions simply make
new functions available in the query language. These functions interface to
otherwise still standalone software systems. This leaves to the user the
burdens of both query formulation and the combination of results for each
single representation into a final judgement. Also, this leads to inefficient
query processing for queries involving several content representations.
<P>
Like any DBMS, a MM-DBMS is a general-purpose software system that
supports various applications; but, the support is targeted to applications in
the specific domain of digital libraries. Four new requirements have been
identified for this domain: (1) multimedia objects can be active objects, (2)
querying is an interaction process, (3) query processing uses multiple
representations, and (4) query formulation provides content independence.
The Mirror Architecture and its implementation in the Mirror DBMS therefore
provide basic functionality for the management of both the content structure
and the logical structure of multimedia objects. 
<P>
In the Mirror DBMS, content management and databases are completely
integrated.  Recognizing the strong relationship with IR query processing, the
inference network retrieval model has been adapted for multimedia retrieval.
The logical algebra of the DBMS has been extended with operators for
probabilistic inference in this retrieval model. This approach to integration
enables the study of new query optimization techniques, and simplifies the
introduction of parallellism and distribution in IR query evaluation.
<P>
Other characteristics of multimedia digital libraries demand the support for
distribution of both data and operations, and extensibility of data types and
operations. As a solution, the integration of advanced middleware and database
technology is proposed to replace the monolithic design of traditional
database systems. Again, this idea has been worked out in a prototype
implementation.
<P>
The proposed MM-DBMS architecture has been evaluated in three ways, using the
Mirror DBMS prototype implementation. First, the advantages of the
integration of content management in the Mirror DBMS have been illustrated by
several example queries capturing different information needs.  The
multimedia IR model developed in this thesis has been tested in some
small-scale experiments in the domains of music and image
retrieval, confirming that reasoning with multiple representations is both
possible and useful. Finally, the execution performance of IR query processing
has been evaluated using a standard text retrieval benchmark.
