We want to operate the firefox on the desktop in the study (connected
to the TV with an HDMI cable)... 

... from the couch in the living room.

Why is this an issue? Well, our study is separated from the living
room by a sliding door that includes the TV - so pausing a movie or
changing the volume involves a walk to the study (and the shortest
route involves sliding away the TV), an inconvenient interruption.

A straightforward solution should be to connect our (Windows)
laptop(s) to the (Linux) desktop using Remote Desktop. [GNOME Remote
Desktop](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Mutter/RemoteDesktop) should
enable just that, but it is, well, pre-alpha; not yet ready for use in
my desktop environment (FC33).

I have documented the steps to make this work at my [RDP at
Home](https://arjenp.dev/RDP/) page.
