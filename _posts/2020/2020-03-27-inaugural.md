Welcome, this is the inaugural blog post for the [ArjenP dot DeV](https://arjenp.dev) blog series.

The main topic of discussion in this online space is Information Retrieval research, highlighting progress 
at the [Radboud University IR group][informagus], at [Spinque][spinque] and at [SPARQUE][sparque].

Other topics you can expect me to write about relate to the broader domain of Data Science, 
Data Engineering including Data(-base) Management, Reproducible Science and Research Data Management, 
Computer Science in general and its impact on science (e.g., digital humanities) and society (e.g., privacy).

Apart from pure scientific research, I plan to write about the joys of programming and running systems yourself,
usually drawn from my own experience at home and work, using Linux and learning Rust.

Posts are in English, or, occasionally, in Dutch.
