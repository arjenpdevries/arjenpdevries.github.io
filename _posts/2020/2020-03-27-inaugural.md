Inaugural post of the [Arjen P dot Dev](https://arjenp.dev) blog.

The main topic of the blog series will be Information Retrieval research, especially developments in
The Netherlands, at Radboud University, and at Spinque and SPARQUE.

Other topics you can expect me to write about relate to the broader domain of Data Science, 
Data Engineering including Data(-base) Management, Reproducible Science and Research Data Management, 
Computer Science in general and its impact on science (e.g., digital humanities) and society (e.g., privacy).

Apart from pure scientific research, I will write about the joys of programming and running systems yourself,
usually drawn from my own experience at home and work, using Linux and learning Rust.

Posts can be written in Dutch or English.
